Couchbase Server Community Edition 1.8

In order to run the application please drag and drop the "Couchbase Server" icon
into the "Applications" folder. You can start the Couchbase Server application
from within the "/Applications" directory.

Notes:

1- Please make sure you have erased the previous Membase/Couchbase
installation from "~/Library/Application Support/Couchbase" and
"~/Library/Application Support/Membase"
2- The application will not start if you attempt to run the server without
copying to a writeable disk. The dmg file which contains "Couchbase Server.app"
is a read-only format and the server needs to be deployed on a writable volume.
3- Couchbase CLI tools (cbstats,cbrestore,cbworkloadgen) are available here:
/Applications/Couchbase\ Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin
