\section*{Letter of Transmittal}
\textbf{Subject.} High Performance Computing in Natural Resources.

\textbf{Purpose.} This report focuses on Hatch project, and the challenges with managing data in the
scientific research environment. The goal is to introduce new approaches to organizing data, and making
it more searchable. The Hatch project creates a foundation for a tool that allows users to upload, search,
format, and visualize their data in ways they didn't think of before. This report highlights some of the 
problems with computation and data management in the current research environment, and makes 
suggestions for new approaches. It talks about specific algorithms for searching data, and standards for
formatting and storing it.

\textbf{Background.} The amount of data being stored in scientific databases today is growing 
exponentially. The amount of computational power in cpu's, however, is no longer growing exponentially.
The consequence is an gap opening between data and results. Researchers are trying to build and rebuild
their computational infrastructure, to try to get computational growth back to the pace of data growth.
But in this report, we suggest a complimentary approach to computing research data. The Hatch project
comes from the idea that a significant amount of research data is redundant or not wanted. But it is also
vast and not managable. Researchers end up wasting computation time on data points and sets that they do 
not care about, at the expense of ones they do care about.

\textbf{Preliminary Work}. With the experience of the authors of this report, there is more than 8 years of work in computer science, bioinformatics, and natural resources. There is 2+ years of work in computing
clusters for the University of Idaho Initiative for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary STudies (IBEST), as well as 
1.5 years of research in wildlife management.

\begin{abstract}
With today's exponential increase of data, the demand for processing is outpacing the supply \cite{gordon_moore}. 
The way we 
processed data yesterday would take years to do today. Unfortunately, the lack of fluency with computing in
today's research proposals results in processing a fraction of the data collected. This weakens research 
projects, and leads to a lot of unnecessary data collection. 

Today's researchers need tools to become more efficient with processing data. Until computation can keep
up again with exponential data growth, researchers will need to carefully select the data that they want to 
do research on, and throw away data that will not yield results. The users of such tools range anywhere from
fish researchers in the Columbia Basin, to bioinformaticians, to economists, and more. Having more 
searchable, usable data applies to almost everyone, and the use cases and usefulness of a tool like Hatch
are endless.
